                        <h2>Client</h2>
                        <p>Casa Ideas is a well-loved Chilean home décor and lifestyle company known for its colorful, creative, and functional products. The brand has grown to become a household name in Latin America.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Despite being a "brand love" with significant presence in Chile and Latin America, Casaldeas had not ventured into e-commerce. The arrival of COVID-19 forced a rapid transition. Their existing help center was generic and managed by Zendesk. Our challenge was to create a new help center for Casaldeas, encompassing product tracking, exchanges, and returns.</p>

                <div class="research">
                    <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
                    <p>We conducted internal research, gathering testimonies from customer service employees to understand current pain points. We also relied on data and analytics from physical stores, since the online channel was less than three months old. Additionally, we analyzed competitors, both nationally (MercadoLibre) and internationally (Amazon), to identify best practices.</p>

                <div class="ideation">
                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p>With the gathered information, we began creating various user personas and their respective customer journeys. These provided insights into potential pain points for each user. This process initiated the creation of the user flow for the new help center and the development of wireframes.</p>

                <div class="testing">
                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>We converted the various flows to high-fidelity UI and created prototypes for rapid usability testing. We evaluated both simple flows like product tracking and more complex ones like returning a product part. We used tools to measure conversion rates, task time, and heatmaps.</p>

                    <p>During the first month of implementation, we achieved:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A 69% reduction in calls to Customer Service.</li>
                        <li>An 89% conversion rate for returns and exchanges on the web channel.</li>
                        <li>A CSAT of 4.78/5.</li>
