                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Internal technological systems and services (backend and other services) within bank teams frequently changed, primarily due to the large scale of these companies. In 2021, Bci Bank, specifically in the corporate banking sector, set out to make a significant change in this regard. The first component selected for upgrade in service level and frontend was the "payment gateway."</p>

                    <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
                    <p>In this project, the research primarily involved aligning with our new payment processing provider to analyze which functionalities could be enabled to generate value for the end user. In this case, the product is B2B, meaning it is sold to businesses, but the final payer is a retail consumer (B2C).</p>

                <div class="ideation">
                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p>Following extensive alignment between internal and external bank teams, the new functionalities were clear. These include high customization for the merchant or company utilizing the "Bci Payment Gateway," such as amount limits, time restrictions, and distinguishing between individual or corporate clients. Additionally, the implementation of an in-house anti-fraud system, a first for the bank, was planned.</p>

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>After creating the wireframes, we generated the initial high-fidelity designs and prototyped them for testing. The new design experience was a significant change from what existed before, much more accessible, responsive across different platforms, and aligned with the bank's design system.</p>
