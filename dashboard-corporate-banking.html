                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>BCI is a major player in corporate banking, with "360 Connect" being the private platform for companies to manage their banking needs. As part of continuous improvement, we aimed to enhance the user experience upon logging in, to add more functionalities, improve information hierarchy, and enhance accessibility.</p>

                <div class="research">
                    <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
                    <p>With a product like 360 Connect, which had over 280k monthly users, we had ample data to analyze user behavior via Google Analytics and conduct direct interviews for qualitative insights on the current dashboard. We also researched other dashboards across various platforms.</p>

                <div class="ideation">
                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p>With all the information gathered during research, we prioritized new dashboard features such as consolidated multi-currency balances, dynamic shortcuts based on user, summary of pending operations, and access to the help center. These were designed in modular blocks that clients could add or remove as they preferred. Additionally, we integrated a new design system that allowed for the inclusion of graphs, enhancing visual language and enabling quicker reading.</p>

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>We conducted various testing stages, starting with usability tests on wireframes, followed by high-fidelity prototypes. In the final stage, a beta version was launched for a select group of clients to evaluate their response to the new solution. We were very satisfied as the behavior met our expectations.</p>
